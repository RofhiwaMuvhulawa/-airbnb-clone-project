üìå Team Roles
Role	Responsibilities
Backend Developer	Develops and maintains RESTful and GraphQL APIs, handles business logic, and ensures application performance and scalability.
Database Administrator (DBA)	Designs and optimizes the database schema, manages indexing and data integrity, and ensures high availability of data.
DevOps Engineer	Implements CI/CD pipelines, manages deployments using Docker, monitors system performance, and ensures system reliability.
QA Engineer	Writes and executes test cases, identifies bugs, verifies feature functionality, and ensures that all APIs meet quality standards.

‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
Technology	Purpose
Django	A high-level Python web framework used to build RESTful APIs and backend logic.
Django REST Framework	Provides powerful tools to create RESTful endpoints and manage serializers, permissions, and views.
PostgreSQL	A robust relational database used for storing all application data including users, bookings, and properties.
GraphQL	Allows flexible and efficient data retrieval by enabling clients to query only the data they need.
Celery	Handles background tasks like sending notifications and processing payments asynchronously.
Redis	Used for caching frequently accessed data and managing Celery task queues.
Docker	Containerizes the application for consistent development and deployment across environments.
CI/CD Tools (GitHub Actions, Docker)	Automates testing, builds, and deployment processes to ensure code reliability and faster iteration.

üóÉÔ∏è Database Design
Entity	Key Fields	Relationships
Users	id, name, email, password, role	Can own multiple properties, can make multiple bookings and leave multiple reviews.
Properties	id, owner_id, title, location, price	Belongs to a user (owner), has many bookings and reviews.
Bookings	id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date	Belongs to a user and a property.
Reviews	id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment	Created by a user for a property.
Payments	id, booking_id, amount, status, timestamp	Linked to a specific booking.

‚ú® Feature Breakdown
User Management: Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Ensures secure authentication and role-based access.

Property Management: Enables hosts to list, update, or delete properties. Users can browse available listings with filters.

Booking System: Lets users make reservations, view booking details, and manage check-in/check-out schedules.

Payment Processing: Handles secure transactions when users book properties, ensuring financial data is stored and processed safely.

Review System: Enables users to rate and review properties they‚Äôve stayed at, improving transparency and trust in the platform.

API Integration: Uses REST and GraphQL APIs for seamless communication between backend and frontend, allowing scalable and efficient data management.

üîí API Security
Security Measure	Importance
Authentication (JWT/Token-based)	Ensures only registered users can access protected endpoints.
Authorization	Prevents users from accessing or modifying data they don‚Äôt own (e.g., another user‚Äôs booking).
Rate Limiting	Protects the API from abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given time frame.
Data Validation & Sanitization	Prevents injection attacks and ensures only valid data is processed.
HTTPS Encryption	Secures communication between client and server, protecting sensitive user and payment information.

üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. This improves code quality and ensures quick, reliable releases.

Tool	Role in CI/CD
GitHub Actions	Automates testing and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.
Docker	Ensures consistency by running the app in containers across development, staging, and production environments.
Celery + Redis	Used in deployment pipelines for background task management and caching.
